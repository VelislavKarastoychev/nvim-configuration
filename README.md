# Configuration of the nvim editor for codding with javascript and nodejs projects:

This repository contains my personal configurations on the nvim in order to work efficiently
in the process of codding. The configurations are taken from the repository of the
youtuber "https://github.com/josean-dev/dev-environment-files". However, I made some additional
changes and added the terminal functionality.

To install the configuration on your ubuntu distribution type the following command in the
terminal:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/VelislavKarastoychev/nvim-configuration
```

# TODO

1. More functionalities for the terminal.
2. Cheat sheets.

Everyone, who wants to use this configuration file may feel free to copy/clone the repository
and to install it.
